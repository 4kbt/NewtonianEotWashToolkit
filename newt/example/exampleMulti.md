# Multipole calculations

We will eventually provide some use cases of the multipole functionality to this library. Hopefully it will illustrate the effectiveness and speed of the multipole calculations over the PointGravity version.

## Moments of homogeneous solids

The beauty of this method relies on having analytically calculated the moments of various shapes centered around the origin. Combining these known moments with translation and rotation formulae allows us to construct intricate massive bodies from their combinations.

## Rotations

Rotations are performed via the Wiger-D matrices using a z-y-z Euler angle representation. More information can be found...

## Translations
